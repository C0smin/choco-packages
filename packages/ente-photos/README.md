## About

Ente was born out of a need to preserve our personal memories. Mainstream services did not respect our privacy, and the rest lacked posterity.  
So we started building an [open source](https://github.com/ente-io/ente) company in 2020 - one that could outlive its people.  
Ente is now a sustainable business funded by customer subscriptions and backed by a [wholesome community](https://ente.io/about#community).

Ente Photos is the private and safe home for your photos and videos. With Ente, your photos and videos are stored end-to-end encrypted (e2ee), which means that only you or those authorised by you can view them.  
Keep your photos private with Ente's end-to-end encryption, app locks, hidden folder, and password protected albums.  
Ente also makes it simple to share your albums with your loved ones. You can share them directly with other Ente users, end-to-end encrypted.
